Classic Snake game written in Python.

Controls: w,a,s,d OR arrows
Exit: q
Pause: p
If you pause the game with p, a text box will appear.
In the text box, you can run commands.
Possible commands:
Exit the game:              exit | quit | q
Start new game:             n | new
Change the color of snake:  c <color_name> | color <color_name>
Change the color of head:   hc <color_name> | headcolor <color_name>
Change background color:    bg <color_name> | background <color_name>
Change the color of food:   fc <color_name> | foodcolor <color_name>

Instead of <color_name> you can write the english name of the color (e.g. yellow, red, blue) OR the RGB code (e.g. #FFFF00, #FF0000, #0000FF)
If Caps Lock is on, the controls don't work (except the arrows).
Enjoy playing!
